*Policy Verification in Stochastic Dynamical Systems Using Logarithmic Neural Certificates by Thom Badings, Wietze Koops, Sebastian
Junges, and Nils Jansen (CAV 2025)*

This paper proposes techniques that make the verification of neural network policies in stochastic dynamical systems more scalable.
In this artifact, we implement these techniques in a learner-verifier framework for verifying that a given neural network policy satisfies a given reach-avoid specification.
The learner trains another neural network, which acts as a certificate proving that the policy satisfies the task.
The verifier then checks whether this neural network certificate is a so-called logarithmic reach-avoid supermartingale (logRASM), which suffices to show reach-avoid guarantees.
For more details about the approach, we refer to the paper above.
